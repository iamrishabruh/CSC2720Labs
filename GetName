def get_name():
    # Prompt the user to enter their name and strip any leading/trailing whitespace
    name = input("What is your name? ").strip()

    # Keep prompting the user until a non-empty name is entered
    while not name:
        name = input("Please enter your name: ").strip()

    return name

# TEST CASE: The get_name function handles the case when the user enters an empty name by prompting them to enter their name again.

def main():
    # Call the get_name function to retrieve the user's name
    name = get_name()

    # Print a greeting message using the retrieved name
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Execute the main function if the script is run directly
